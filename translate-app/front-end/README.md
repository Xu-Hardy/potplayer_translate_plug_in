# Getting Started with Create React App

Using React, I made a translation UI, and can access different translation APIs as needed


## Real time translation software

### Functions and features:

Two-way translation: Supports two-way translation from English to Chinese and Chinese to English.

Immediate feedback: As the user enters text in the text box, the translation is performed and displayed immediately, providing immediate feedback to the user.

Simple user interface: The design is simple and easy to use, so users can use it intuitively.

Adaptive text box: The text box can be adjusted automatically according to the length of the input content to optimize the user experience.

One-click switching: You can easily switch the direction of translation with the click of a button.

### Technical details:

Front-end: Built using the React framework, it has the characteristics of componentization to ensure maintainability and scalability.

Backend interaction: Use Axios to make asynchronous HTTP requests and communicate with backend APIs.

Server-side API: This software relies on a back-end API to provide translation functions. The specific translation logic and translation engine are handled on the server side.

### How to use:

Type the text you want to translate in the “Input” text box.
In the output area below, you can see the translated text.
To switch the translation direction (for example, from English to Chinese to Chinese), just click the button at the top of the page.

使用 React，我制作了一个翻译用户界面，可以根据需要访问不同的翻译 API


## 实时翻译软件

### 功能和特点：

双向翻译：支持英文到中文和中文到英语的双向翻译。

即时反馈：当用户在文本框中输入文本时，会立即执行和显示翻译，从而向用户提供即时反馈。

简单的用户界面：该设计简单易用，因此用户可以直观地使用它。

自适应文本框：可以根据输入内容的长度自动调整文本框，以优化用户体验。

一键切换：您可以通过单击按钮轻松切换翻译方向。

### 技术细节：

前端：使用 React 框架构建，它具有组件化的特性，可确保可维护性和可扩展性。

后端交互：使用 Axios 发出异步 HTTP 请求并与后端 API 通信。

服务器端 API：该软件依赖后端 API 来提供翻译功能。特定的翻译逻辑和翻译引擎由服务器端处理。

### 如何使用：

在 “输入” 文本框中键入要翻译的文本。
在下面的输出区域中，你可以看到翻译后的文本。
要切换翻译方向（例如，从英语到中文再到中文），只需点击页面顶部的按钮即可。

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
